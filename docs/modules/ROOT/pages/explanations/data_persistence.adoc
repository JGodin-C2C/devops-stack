= Data Persistence

At Camptocamp, we prefer to have a clear separation
between compute workload and storage.
Hence, we try to have our clusters totally stateless and do data persistence
out of the cluster (external RDBMS, NoSQL databases or object storage).

That means that we don't use storageClasses that would allow self provisioning
of Persistent Volumes (PVs).
Moreover, usage of storageClasses would break the blue/green infrastructure
paradigm that the DevOps Stack supports.
